# creativecoding_midterm_Si-Yue
this is my creative coding midterm

the design creates the feeling of tranquility following a rain shower

created a loop of falling raindrops
as time passes, less raindrops begin to fall

added function for raindrop splashes
when this.position > height, start drawing a ring of circles that increase in size over time
eventually they disappear

created a sun that rises as time passes
the sky also changes color as the sun moves higher

as the sun reaches the highest predetermined location in the sky, transparent circles appear, floating around

create a landscape of geometrical trees and flowers using cool-toned colors, have the colors become warmer as the sun rises
to get this effect, create ranged for where when the trees are certain colors --> put it into an if else --> first put down the base color, then add the new color on top, gradually increasing the transparency
