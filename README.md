# creativecoding_midterm_Si-Yue
this is my creative coding midterm

the design creates the feeling of tranquility following a rain shower

created a loop of falling raindrops
as time passes, less raindrops begin to fall

added function for raindrop splashes
when this.position > height, start drawing a ring of circles that increase in size over time
eventually they disappear

created a sun that rises as time passes
the sky also changes color as the sun moves higher

river changes from dark to light over time
